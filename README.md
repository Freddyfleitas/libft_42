## ¿What's Libft?

Libft marks the beginning of the path at 42 School. It consists of recreating key functions to understand them thoroughly, and inspires us to develop our own customized functions according to our needs.

## Libft's content

1. **Libc functions:** Essential functions built into C for basic programming operations.
2. **Additional functions:** Complementary functions that expand the knowledge of memory allocation.
3. **Bonus functions:** Extra functions that teach about linked lists manipulation.

## Libft: From Easy to Difficult (According to me)

As we move forward with the project, the functions become increasingly challenging. In light of this, i have proposed a sequential checklist for implementation.

 <sub>Libc functions:

* Strlen
 - [ ]Isalpha

 - [ ]Isprint
 - [ ]Toupper
 - [ ]Tolower
 - [ ]Memset
 - [ ]Bzero
 - [ ]Strlcpy
 - [ ]Strchr
 - [ ]Strrchr
 - [ ]Strncmp
 - [ ]Strnstr
 - [ ]Memcpy
 - [ ]Memchr
*Memcmp
*Atoi
*Strlcat
*Memmove
